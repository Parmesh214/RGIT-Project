# Smart Document Summarizer

A no-code AI agent built for the Agent X Hackathon at RGIT.

## Project Overview

The **Smart Document Summarizer** automatically extracts key points from lengthy documents and generates concise summaries. Built on the Uptiq.ai no-code platform, this project demonstrates how AI can be made accessible to everyone without the need for traditional coding.

## Features

- **No-Code AI Agent:** Leverages Uptiq.ai’s platform for easy AI development.
- **Intelligent Summarization:** Extracts essential information from documents to produce clear and concise summaries.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for simplicity and efficiency.

## Getting Started

Since this project is built on a no-code platform, you can explore and interact with the summarization workflow directly on Uptiq.ai.

*Optional:* To review or extend the project code, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parmesh214/RGIT-Project.git
cd RGIT-Project
```
